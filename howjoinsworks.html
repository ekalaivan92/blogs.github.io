            <p>
              Hi, I am going to explain the basics of joins in SQL queries.
              This idea of writing a blog about SQL joins came to me and my
              colleagues while discussing the joining of two tables. The basic
              idea of this blog is to provide clarity to beginners and
              intermediate programmers who don't have an idea of how joins
              work.
            </p>
            <h2>What are Joins</h2>
            <p>
              Joins are used to combine data from two tables. Most of the
              time, joins are done using primary key and foreign key
              relationships. Some of our databases may have the foreign key
              relationships defined, while others may not. The relation
              between two tables is based on business-related understanding.
              This means the relationship comes from the business logic, not
              from the technology. For example, the &quot;orders&quot; table
              and &quot;order items&quot; table are related by business
              understanding. An order contains a list of items. When we bring
              this concept into programming, we express that &quot;order
              items&quot; are under a specific order. To establish this
              relationship, we use primary key and foreign key relationships.
              The program/technology doesn&#x27;t even know about the data and
              relationship; it just states that this table is linked to that
              table by certain columns. Additionally, it specifies that
              references are available and that we can&#x27;t delete certain
              records, and so on.
            </p>
            <h2>What are the Various Join Types</h2>
            <p>
              There are multiple types of joins, which can be grouped as
              follows:
              <ul>
                <li>FULL JOIN</li>
                <li>INNER JOIN</li>
                <li>OUTER JOIN</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              For more details, visit:
              <a
                href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins">Visual Representation of SQL Joins</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding the types of joins may be simple, but the
              challenge lies in how we perform the join. For example, if I
              have two tables, &quot;customers&quot; and &quot;students,&quot;
              and there is no direct relationship between them, can I join
              these tables? If you say
              <code>no</code>, then the understanding may need to be
              clarified. Basically, how we write joins is as follows:
            </p>
            <pre
              class="code code-wrap"><code>select &lt;columns&gt; from &lt;table1&gt; &lt;Inner/Left/right&gt; join &lt;table2&gt; on &lt;conditions&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Here, the joining is done via the condition rather than the
              keys. I want to join &quot;table1&quot; to &quot;table2&quot;
              with a specific condition. The SQL query condition is a
              comparison expression that represents a boolean result, which is
              quite simple, right? For the above question, business logic says
              the join is invalid, not that we can&#x27;t join. Technically,
              we can join the tables, but the result may not be meaningful.
            </p>
            <h2>How Does Joins Work</h2>
            <p>
              Basically, joins work in a simple way. Think of it like this:
              the rows of &quot;table1&quot; are compared with each row in
              &quot;table2&quot; based on the condition. This is done via an
              iteration of each row in both tables. During the joining
              process, the rows that satisfy the condition are added to the
              result, while the others are ignored and not added to the
              result.
            </p>
            <p>
              In simple words, each row on table one iterated with foreach and compared with each row
              in the table 2 iterated with another foreach loop. So each one row from table one
              iterated with all rows in the table 2 via the nested foreach loop. like this,
            </p>
            <pre class="code"><code>foreach(var row in table1.rows)
{
  foreach(var row1 in table2.rows)
  {
    if(condition)
    {
      //Add to results
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>For example, consider the following tables:</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <strong>Table 1:</strong>
                <table class="table">
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Id</td>
                      <td>Name</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>1</td>
                      <td>A</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>2</td>
                      <td>B</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>3</td>
                      <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <strong>Table 2:</strong>
                <table class="table">
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td>key</td>
                      <td>Value</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>one</td>
                      <td>1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>two</td>
                      <td>2</td>
                    </tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>I am going to join both tables. How will I write the query?</p>
            <pre
              class="code code-wrap"><code>select id, name, key, value from table1 left join table2 on &lt;condition&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              In this situation, if we give the condition as
              <em><strong>1 = 1</strong></em> or
              <em><strong>true = true</strong></em>, which always returns <code>true</code>, then the result will
              join all rows in table 1 with all rows in table 2 and return. The result will look like:
            </p>

            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>id</td>
                  <td>name</td>
                  <td>key</td>
                  <td>value</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>A</td>
                  <td>one</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>A</td>
                  <td>two</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>B</td>
                  <td>one</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>B</td>
                  <td>two</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>C</td>
                  <td>one</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>C</td>
                  <td>two</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
              Alternatively, if we give the condition as
              <em><strong>1 = 2</strong></em> or
              <em><strong>true = false</strong></em>, which always results in <code>false</code>, no rows will be
              returned. The result will look like:
            </p>
            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>id</td>
                  <td>name</td>
                  <td>key</td>
                  <td>value</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
              For example, if we give the condition as
              <em><strong>id = 1</strong></em>, then only the rows that satisfy the condition, i.e., rows
              with <em><strong>id</strong></em> as <em><strong>1</strong></em>, will be returned. The result will look
              like:
            </p>
            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>id</td>
                  <td>name</td>
                  <td>key</td>
                  <td>value</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>A</td>
                  <td>one</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>A</td>
                  <td>two</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <h2>Using Multiple Join Conditions</h2>
            <p>
              We can use multiple join conditions to join one table to
              another. We can use as many conditions on the join as required.
              The conditions are finally used or combined with logical
              operators like
              <em><strong>AND, OR</strong></em>, etc. These conditions are similar to the conditions used in
              the WHERE clause. We can also use subqueries in the condition;
              ultimately, it should be a comparison expression results in
              Boolean result.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              A join query doesn&#x27;t necessarily require a relationship to
              join technically. A join needs a condition / a comparison
              expression that results in a Boolean value. However, in most
              cases, we join tables that have relationship between them. The
              situation of joining tables without a direct relationship occurs
              rarely, but understanding how joins work is important.
            </p>
