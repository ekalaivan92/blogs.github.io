        Hi, I am going to explain the basics of joins in SQL queries.
        This idea of writing a blog about SQL joins came when me and my
        colleagues discussing joining two tables. The basic
        idea of this blog is to provide clarity to beginners and
        intermediate programmers who don't have an idea of how joins
        works.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">What are Joins</h2>

    <p>
        Joins are used to combine data from two or more tables. Most of the
        time, joins are done using primary key and foreign key
        relationships. Some of our databases may have the foreign key
        relationships defined, while others may not. The relation
        between two tables is based on business-related understanding.
        This means the relationship comes from the business logic, not
        from the technology. For example, the &quot;orders&quot; table
        and &quot;order items&quot; table are related by business
        understanding. An order contains a list of items. When we bring
        this concept into programming, we express that &quot;order
        items&quot; are under a specific order. To establish this
        relationship, we use primary key and foreign key relationships.
        The program/technology doesn&#x27;t even know about the data and
        relationship; it just states that this table is linked to that
        table by certain columns. Additionally, it specifies that
        references are available and that we can&#x27;t delete certain
        records, and so on.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">What are the Various Join Types</h2>

    <p>
        There are multiple types of joins, which can be grouped as
        follows:
        <ul>
            <li>FULL JOIN</li>
            <li>INNER JOIN</li>
            <li>OUTER JOIN</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        For more details, visit:
        <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins">Visual Representation of
            SQL Joins</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Understanding the types of joins may be simple, but the
        challenge lies in how we perform the join. For example, if I
        have two tables, &quot;customers&quot; and &quot;students,&quot;
        and there is no direct relationship between them, can I join
        these tables? If you say
        <code>no</code>, then the understanding may need to be
        clarified. Basically, how we write joins is as follows:
    </p>

    <pre lang="language-sql" class="rounded">
        <code>
select 
    &lt;columns&gt; 
from 
    &lt;table1&gt;
    Inner/Left/right&gt; join &lt;table2&gt; 
        on &lt;conditions&gt;</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Here, the joining is done via the condition rather than the
        keys. I want to join &quot;table1&quot; to &quot;table2&quot;
        with a specific condition. The SQL query condition is a
        comparison expression that represents a boolean result, which is
        quite simple, right? For the above question, business logic says
        the join is invalid, not that we can&#x27;t join. Technically,
        we can join the tables, but the result may not be meaningful.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">How Does Joins Work</h2>

    <p>
        Basically, joins work in a simple way. Think of it like this:
        the rows of &quot;table1&quot; are compared with each row in
        &quot;table2&quot; based on the condition. This is done via an
        iteration of each row in both tables. During the joining
        process, the rows that satisfy the condition are added to the
        result, while the others are ignored and not added to the
        result.
    </p>

    <p>
        In simple words, each row on table one iterated with foreach and compared with each row
        in the table 2 iterated with another foreach loop. So each one row from table one
        iterated with all rows in the table 2 via the nested foreach loop. like this,
    </p>

    <pre lang="language-cs" class="rounded">
        <code>
foreach(var row in table1.rows)
{
    foreach(var row1 in table2.rows)
    {
        if(condition)
        {
            //Add to results
        }
    }
}</code>
    </pre>

    <p>For example, consider the following tables:</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <strong>Table 1:</strong>
            <table class="table">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Id</td>
                        <td>Name</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td>A</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>2</td>
                        <td>B</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <strong>Table 2:</strong>
            <table class="table">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>key</td>
                        <td>Value</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>one</td>
                        <td>1</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>two</td>
                        <td>2</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I am going to join both tables. How will I write the query?</p>

    <pre lang="language-sql" class="rounded">
        <code>
select 
    id, name, key, value 
from 
    table1 
    left join table2 
        on &lt;condition&gt;</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        In this situation, if we give the condition as
        <em><strong>1 = 1</strong></em> or
        <em><strong>true = true</strong></em>, which always returns <code>true</code>, then the result will
        join all rows in table 1 with all rows in table 2 and return. The result will look like:
    </p>

    <table class="table">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>id</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>key</td>
                <td>value</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>one</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>two</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>one</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>two</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>one</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>two</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Alternatively, if we give the condition as
        <em><strong>1 = 2</strong></em> or
        <em><strong>true = false</strong></em>, which always results in <code>false</code>, no rows will be
        returned. The result will look like:
    </p>
    <table class="table">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>id</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>key</td>
                <td>value</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="text-center font-monospace" colspan="4">No rows</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        For example, if we give the condition as
        <em><strong>id = 1</strong></em>, then only the rows that satisfy the condition, i.e., rows
        with <em><strong>id</strong></em> as <em><strong>1</strong></em>, will be returned. The result will look
        like:
    </p>
    <table class="table">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>id</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>key</td>
                <td>value</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>one</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>two</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 class="mt-3">Using Multiple Join Conditions</h2>

    <p>
        We can use multiple join conditions to join one table to
        another. We can use as many conditions on the join as required.
        The conditions are finally used or combined with logical
        operators like
        <em><strong>AND, OR</strong></em>, etc. These conditions are similar to the conditions used in
        the WHERE clause. We can also use subqueries in the condition;
        ultimately, it should be a comparison expression results in
        Boolean result.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        A join query doesn&#x27;t necessarily require a relationship to
        join technically. A join needs a condition / a comparison
        expression that results in a Boolean value. However, in most
        cases, we join tables that have relationship between them. The
        situation of joining tables without a direct relationship occurs
        rarely, but understanding how joins work is important.
