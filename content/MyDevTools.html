    <strong>LinqPad</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>
    This is a simple tool to execute C#, F#, VB codes as single Line of
    code / expression, statement(s) or a Program. This is important to me,
    to try to do a simple testing on my understanding while learning or
    experimenting. Let say I am experimenting the JSON merge concepts
    using NewtonSoft.Json, While doing this I might want to do lot of work
    before I am going to do the actual experiment. Example, I have to
    create a Console application / anything using visual studio or any
    other IDE and clean up that project, create required file and etc. But
    with linqPad I can simply write my three line of code and done the
    experiment. It allows us to do lot more thing like create lots of
    classes, or import existing linqpad scripts and use functionality from
    that script, add Nuget packages or refer DLLs, ect.
